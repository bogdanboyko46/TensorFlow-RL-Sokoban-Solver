sokobangamepy.py was originally a copy and paste of a snake game made in pygame, found on youtube (we are learning how to use pygame for first time, so we first understood the code for the snake game first and then changed it bit by bit til it was sokoban), generic comments left are from that, not chatgpt copy and paste slop

RECENT COMMIT TOT REWARD VS GAME NUMBER: (result of adding more negative rewards to avoid redundant moves) (This was from an old commit that dealt with only a single block-hole pair state)
